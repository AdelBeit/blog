## Motivation

Creativity is self expression and self expression is difficult for the analytically inclined. Software Engineers are as analytical as they come. As such, producing images from ideas is very challenging for me. But none of that will stop me from trying, to create inspiring UIs that are also accessible, responsive, and functional!

### Vision 

My vision for my website and my blog is based on my favorite literary and artistic genre: cyberpunk. This goes back to how I view the world — a desolate and hopeless place, where everything competes for survival for as long as possible, only to perish at the end, leaving a mark on the universe as significant as my vote did in the last election. I digress. Cyberpunk: it's futuristic, it's grim and dystopian, sometimes dark — lit with nothing but neon, so much neon! It also tends to be minimalistic at times which I really enjoy. I can't put into words how much I love seeing a well-executed cyberpunk aesthetic; it draws me like peanut butter does a dog.

## Design Process

My design process goes as follows; Come up with an idea and an aesthetic (based on a feeling, mood, or message you want to express) then look for other works that capture that idea well, and try to draw inspiration from them as you develop. 

Here are some designs (among many) that initially inspired me:

### Experiments

I spent too long trying to come up with an original look, mixing and matching different elements from the sources listed above. Here are some snapshots from the many experiments I did trying to make the perfect design. You can view my entire Figma design journey by clicking on this image.

## Challenges


The biggest challenge was coming up with a design that was cross platform and responsive, the problem with cyberpunk designs is that they are not very flexible with sizing and spacing, they will lose quality with the slightest amount of stretching or compression. My solution was to create a decoupled card based design where content is split up into atomic units that can be individually presented with a variety but limited set of looks or 'cards'. So the Navbar is comprised of individual free floating buttons, and so is each card that contains bite sized information, like a project, or 'about me', etc... 

That way I ensure 

I followed the same design philosophy
